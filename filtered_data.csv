The teaching staff suffer from the common apathy of most teachers in similar colleges. The administration has the usual problems, with ill-paid employees periodically going on strike. On the whole, the college is a very normal place. But on this particular day, when Madan and his friends rise from their slumber, some with the customary hangover, they are not so perturbed to find no water in the taps again, as when they hear that it is not going to be a holiday after all. Instead there will be a lecture in the auditorium by the Chairman of the Board (Dr. Shriram Lagoo), on the day of the festival of fire, Holi, and the boys decide not to attend the classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some human links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student, in which the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated. It is an unjustifiably drastic punishment, and the news spreads like wildfire. Resistance is organized in the library, in the laboratory, in the classrooms and the college grounds. In the auditorium, the first egg hits the Chairman, and pandemonium follows. To save his own job, the principal decides to track down the culprits. Professor Singh politely refuses to help. The principal now blackmails one of the hostel boys, whose father he knows, and who is in any case a loner, and a butt of jokes in the campus. Imbued with a false sense of power, the boy walks into the principal's trap. A large group of boys, all from the hostel, are immediately rusticated, and asked to vacate their rooms by the morning. The boys, not all of them actually guilty of rebellion, are now all in a rage. They make a bonfire of the hostel furniture and their textbooks. Feeling impelled to share his sense of triumph, the informer confides in the boy whom he hates and fears the most, and whose name he has kept out of the list. As a result he is mercilessly humiliated by everyone, and just about manages to rush away from his tormentors and lock himself in his room. In the gathering dusk, the young rebels sit listlessly on the steps of the hostel, their anger giving way to depression, when one of them discovers the informer hanging from the fan in his room, quite dead. Madan and his friends confront faceless policemen who come to investigate the suicide. In the morning, the police van carrying the boys away, is caught in the midst of a rowdy, jostling crowd of merrymakers, playing with colours.

tt0068532,Ek Nazar,"Directed by B.R. Ishara, Ek Nazar is a poignant romantic drama that showcases the complexities of love, ambition, and sacrifice. Featuring the charismatic pair of Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bhaduri (later Jaya Bachchan), this film is a compelling watch for fans of classic Bollywood cinema. Plot Overview The story revolves around Rajesh (Amitabh Bachchan), a poet who finds himself captivated by Shabnam (Jaya Bhaduri), a courtesan with an enigmatic personality and a haunting past. Their relationship blossoms despite societal norms and their personal struggles. The film delves into themes of redemption, societal hypocrisy, and the power of love to transcend barriers. Performances Amitabh Bachchan, in one of his earlier roles, delivers a restrained and heartfelt performance as Rajesh. His portrayal of a tortured poet is convincing, hinting at the superstar he would later become. Jaya Bhaduri shines as Shabnam, bringing depth and vulnerability to her character. Her nuanced expressions and understated acting style perfectly complement Bachchan's intensity. Music The soulful music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, combined with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri, is one of the film's highlights.

tt0232641,Siddeshwari,"An impressionistic biographical look at Siddheshwari Devi (19081977), the classical Indian singer whose voice was appreciated by the maharajas and public alike. She was from Varanasi, India, known as Maa (mother). Born in 1907, she lost her parents early and was brought up by her aunt, the noted singer Rajeshwari Devi. She won many accolades during her career, including ""Padma Shri"" by the Government of India (1966). Despite living in a musical household, Siddheswari came to music by accident. Rajeshwari had arranged musical training for her own daughter, Kamleshwari, while Siddheswari would do small chores around the house. Once, while the noted sarangi player Siyaji Mishra, was teaching Kamleshwari, she was unable to repeat the tappa that she was being taught. Rajeshwari ran out of patience, and started to cane Kamleshwari, who cried out for help. The only person to help her was her close friend Siddheswari, who ran from the kitchen to hug her cousin, and took the thrashing on her own body. At this point, Siddheswari told her weeping cousin, ""It's not so difficult to sing what Siyaji Maharaj was telling you."" Siddheswari then showed her how to sing it, performing the whole tune perfectly, much to the amazement of everyone. The next day, Siyaji Maharaj came to Rajeshwari, and asked to adopt Siddheswari into his own family (they were childless). So Siddheswari moved in with the couple, eventually becoming a great friend and support for them. This moving incident was very vivid in Siddheswari's mind, and is detailed in the biography Maa, co-authored by her daughter Savita Devi.",1990,7.4,Documentary,107.0,"Mita Vashisht, Muhar Biswas, Ranjana Srivastava, Shravani Mukherjee, Pandit Narayan Misra",Mani Kaul,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJlMTQyZjEtM2U1Ni00OWI2LWE0NjYtZWFhMzJlNDczMjM3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR11,0,190,281_.jpg"
