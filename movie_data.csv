On the whole, the college is a very normal place. But on this particular day, when Madan and his friends rise from their slumber, some with the customary hangover, they are not so perturbed to find no water in the taps again, as when they hear that it is not going to be a holiday after all. Instead there will be a lecture in the auditorium by the Chairman of the Board (Dr. Shriram Lagoo), on the day of the festival of fire, Holi, and the boys decide not to attend the classes. The hostel superintendent Professor Singh (Naseeruddin Shah), the only lecturer with some human links with the students, watches with apprehension their growing restlessness. A notice announcing a further postponement of examinations adds to the bitterness. A fight erupts out of nowhere between principal Phande's (Om Puri) nephew and another student, in which the principal's nephew is hurt and the other boy is promptly rusticated. It is an unjustifiably drastic punishment, and the news spreads like wildfire. Resistance is organized in the library, in the laboratory, in the classrooms and the college grounds. In the auditorium, the first egg hits the Chairman, and pandemonium follows. To save his own job, the principal decides to track down the culprits. Professor Singh politely refuses to help. The principal now blackmails one of the hostel boys, whose father he knows, and who is in any case a loner, and a butt of jokes in the campus. Imbued with a false sense of power, the boy walks into the principal's trap. A large group of boys, all from the hostel, are immediately rusticated, and asked to vacate their rooms by the morning. The boys, not all of them actually guilty of rebellion, are now all in a rage. They make a bonfire of the hostel furniture and their textbooks. Feeling impelled to share his sense of triumph, the informer confides in the boy whom he hates and fears the most, and whose name he has kept out of the list. As a result he is mercilessly humiliated by everyone, and just about manages to rush away from his tormentors and lock himself in his room. In the gathering dusk, the young rebels sit listlessly on the steps of the hostel, their anger giving way to depression, when one of them discovers the informer hanging from the fan in his room, quite dead. Madan and his friends confront faceless policemen who come to investigate the suicide.

They hear a knock at the door along with a cry for help, sparking a disagreement about whether to answer it. The more dominant soldier (Soldier 1) decides that they will only let the person in if he can solve a riddle. The man at the door (Journalist, played by Kumud Mishra) claims to be a YouTube journalist and answers the riddle correctly. Before entering, Soldier 2 hides away. The Journalist is searching for his wife and daughter, trying to charge his phone and find a signal. He eventually gets a connection and learns that he needs something valuable to buy fuel for his car in order to reach them, as he has lost everything in the war. Soldier 1 tempts the Journalist to retrieve the sanduk (chest) from the well, making the Journalist suspicious of Soldier 1's mental state. When the Journalist asks for help, Soldier 1 insists that the sanduk is all he has to offer. This frustrates the Journalist, who thinks Soldier 1 is crazy and that the sanduk is just a myth. To his surprise, Soldier 1 actually pulls the sanduk out of the well. The Journalist asks what's inside the sanduk, but Soldier 1 gives a vague answer that confuses him. He says, ""The sanduk contains whatever is inside here,"" (pointing to his brain). Assuming it contains something valuable, the Journalist tries to negotiate for it to save his family. Just then, a third person enters the mansion and introduces himself as an Alien from Kepler 186-F (played by Dharmesh Yelande). He claims to have come to Earth to collect something valuable and offers advanced technology in exchange for the sanduk. The Journalist and Soldier 1 are skeptical, but after seeing some of the Alien's tricks, Soldier 1 begins to believe him, while the Journalist remains doubtful. As tension rises, the Journalist challenges the Alien to prove his identity. He asks the Alien to go to Mars, and the Alien shows a video from Mars, impressing the Journalist and making him start to believe. A fourth person silently observes everything from a hidden corner. The struggle for the sanduk intensifies with the question, ""What's inside the sanduk?"" Confused about whom to give it to, Soldier 1 proposes a riddle game, with the winner receiving the sanduk. The competition ends in a tie, with each contestant answering two riddles correctly. As the fight for the sanduk turns violent, Soldier 1 is struck on the head and falls dead. In the chaos, the Journalist shoots the Alien, revealing him to be a human con-man pretending to be an alien. As the Journalist moves to take the sanduk, he is shot and pushed into the well by the hidden fourth person, who seizes the sanduk. In a final attempt to escape the well, the Journalist shoots the fourth person, ensuring that Soldier 1 is dead. However, Soldier 1 cleverly fakes his own death, allowing the Journalist to die as well-even though he could have saved him. Flashback We learn that Soldier 1's twin brother was killed in the war. He had been imagining his twin brother, who wasn't really there. This is why he quit the war and began to hate it, believing that war is a result of greed. Final Monologue Finally, we see that everyone who sought the sanduk ends up dead. In the final monologue, Soldier 1 repeats the king's question to the saint about the sanduk. The saint smiles and says, ""I crafted this sanduk from the human skull.""",2025,9.1,43

Now Anand and his family are all wealthy and live in a palatial home. Anand gets to talking to Bhagwan Shri Kishan, who regularly visits him and asks about him and his family. Anand proudly takes all the credit, and asks Kishan to accompany him to see his success and his hotel. Bhagwan Kishan declines, but agrees do so later. Things don't go quite as well for Anand, when he finds out that Nekiram has been cheating him. Nekiram leaves the house, but Madhu accompanies him. Then Anand finds that Govind has been squandering money and time on women and alcohol; and to top his disappointment Kamla gets pregnant. When Bhagwan Kishan comes to visit Anand again, he admits that he is a failure, his health is poor, and his family are all strangers to him. Lord Kishan advises Anand that this is his life and he must learn from the Mahabharat, and that every life is a struggle, which is confused by relations and near and dear ones, and also by one's ego. Once the ego is removed, then only one can see clearly. But will Anand be able to understand and carry out what Lord Kishan is asking him to? Or will end up taking the blame, like he took the credit, upon himself?",1977,7.1,60

With various outfits of terrorism spreading its tentacles across the world this three centuries old quote of Denis Diderot seems to be apt and as contemporary as it can be. With vulnerable youths falling for the stories of getting an opportunity to work for Allah and empowered with thoughts that your hands will kill the innocent but Allah will forgive all has given these youths the notion that all is fair on the course of Jihad. In the history of mankind, fanaticism has caused more harm than any vice. Despite a space of several years the wounds inflicted by the Indian army in Kashmir were still fresh in Altaaf's mind when he joined the terrorist outfit with the pious thoughts of wiping away the enemies of Islam. Little did he know that he had in turn, gullibly fallen into the trap of people with vested interest and crooked ideas. During one of his assignments Altaaf meets Bhavna, widow of a doctor they had once killed on the suspicion of being an informer of the army. Holed out at Bhavna's house, Altaaf undergoes a metamorphosis as he witnesses Bhavna's plight and helplessness. History however, is replete with the stories of Jihadis or the soldiers of the Holy War, who at some point during their fight for religion realize that they have taken an erroneous decision. Realize that bullets can win wars but not hearts and in the bargain comprehend that they are treading on a path of no return. Jihad is the journey of the militant Altaaf and his realization of the futility of his holy war as he stumbles upon a few truths. That unfortunately Jihad is generally misunderstood to be true Islam. Whereas Islam stands for humanity. Islam prevails amidst brotherhood of people. And Altaaf also learns the supreme truth. That the true meaning of Jihad is not the holy war outside but the war within. Jihad is nothing but overpowering your inner devil. Firearms can give death, not life. Impart life if you can..!!.

Most of us lose focus and give up. We are most afraid to believe in our own dreams. Those who do are the true winners. This slice of life film is set in the backdrop of our capital city- Delhi. A city that brings in thousands of North Indians in search of opportunities that was never available in their own home towns. Like-wise, six boys from different states come together to share a two BHK apartment in a middle-class colony, which they lovingly call ""Sadda Adda"". This film is their story. It is about how six bachelors, with completely different backgrounds and personalities, live together. Their apartment ""Sadda Adda"" is a complete mess with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts, unwashed clothes, mattresses tossed all over the floor etc - yet together they cook food, clean, buy groceries, pay rent, laugh, cry, fight over insignificant issues and always stand up for each other - like a family. ""Sadda Adda"" which began as a transitional accommodation to help them work towards their dreams, becomes their home. The film takes us through a journey of their camaraderie and self-belief. The interwoven stories of these 6 characters takes us through a heart warming journey of the lives of these boys. This movie is about real characters from life who have fun, who fight the wave everyday and through very light heart moments inspire us in the most modest way. The crests and troughs that shape them into the men they will become in the future - because Boys will not always be boys.",2012,7.0,71

Yet, his sanctuary is shattered when a devastating breakup leaves him emotionally crippled, his heart a fractured canvas, splattered with the hues of despair.

Plot Overview The story revolves around Rajesh (Amitabh Bachchan), a poet who finds himself captivated by Shabnam (Jaya Bhaduri), a courtesan with an enigmatic personality and a haunting past. Their relationship blossoms despite societal norms and their personal struggles. The film delves into themes of redemption, societal hypocrisy, and the power of love to transcend barriers. Performances Amitabh Bachchan, in one of his earlier roles, delivers a restrained and heartfelt performance as Rajesh. His portrayal of a tortured poet is convincing, hinting at the superstar he would later become. Jaya Bhaduri shines as Shabnam, bringing depth and vulnerability to her character. Her nuanced expressions and understated acting style perfectly complement Bachchan's intensity. Music The soulful music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, combined with lyrics by Majrooh Sultanpuri, is one of the film's highlights. Songs like ""Patta Patta Boota Boota"" (sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi) remain timeless, beautifully reflecting the film's melancholic and romantic undertones. Overall, Ek Nazar is a classic that highlights the magic of early Bollywood romance with a touch of social commentary. The film is an ode to love's transformative power and the sacrifices it demands.

But today, its grandeur has also become ubiquitous with the ravages of terrorism and counter terrorism operations. Under these circumstances, anyone roaming these hills would tell you the shocking truth: that combat soldiers are statistically safer than women. The calm melody of the idyllic villages is disrupted by the abrasive sputter of semi-automatic gunfire. In one such neighborhood, we see Aasma, a delicate young girl. For Aasma, heaven and hell are about to collide. The leader of the local village conceals four armed militants from across the border, in his house. In due course they notice the young girl. Mesmerized by her delicate beauty and overcome by lust, they kidnap Aasma. Their leader reasons that on their way to a suicidal terrorist attack, this is probably their last opportunity to be with a woman before martyrdom. As Aasmaa's night of torment unfolds, one of the militants, Intekhaab, shows signs of regret; he knows that Islam does not permit cruelty on woman. But in the presence of armed hostility he must find clever ways to delay the inevitable. In the tight, cramped quarters, the odds are stacked against Intekhaab: can he find a way to save Assma - and himself? Can a different face of so-called Islamic terrorism emerge from this desperate plight, so that Aasma is not yet another faceless victim of this endless conflict?",2025,4.6,99

If we go all the way back to Romeo and Juliet and Laila Majnu, and everything in between, we see that conflict is what drives the love story forward. It is always an impossible love story - warring families, ancient enmities, different religious and class identities etc. Yet, what greater conflict can there be between two lovers if both of them want to transition into the opposite sex? Lala loves Poppy, as a man does a woman. But he doesn't identify with his assigned sex at birth. He feels he is a woman trapped in a man's body. Poppy loves Lala as a woman loves a man. But she doesn't identify with her assigned sex either - she feels like a man trapped in a woman's body. What will happen to their love story if Lala and Poppy swap sexes? Will Lala, now a female, continue to love Poppy, now a male, and vice versa? In a new world order in which gender is getting increasingly fluid, and non binary, we present a tale of two star crossed lovers like never seen before on any screen. Society will never accept them, and that's OK. What hurts is when their own families don't accept them.

His thoughts were like the flames of fire and acts were deadly blasts. The forgotten hero return back from the darkness, created by selfish politics to the silver screen as the daring and dynamic protagonist of all time created by writer, director, actor Aazaad. The nationalistic flavour - colour - nature combination of the movie is a continuation of what he has been portraying in his earlier movies. While his earlier movies had element of nationalism, Rashtraputra showcased the reality, the lesser known facts of the greatest revolutionary, Chandrashekhar Azad. Azad was not only the commander - in - chief of Hindustan Socialist Republican Army (HSRA) but an unmatched mentor, friend - philosopher - guide of over two thousand and five hundred revolutionaries of HSRA like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, Bhagwaticharan Vohra, Durga Bhabhi, Batukeshwar Dutt, Madanlal Dhingra, etc. In the true sense of meaning Chandrashekhar Azad was the supreme force of the bloodstained revolutionary freedom movement of India. In this film Rashtraputra we have shown that Azad is a timeless cinematic creation. He was, He is and he will be the relevant hero of all time. Time changes but the problems remain the same in different looks. What would Azad do, how he would react if he was alive today? He would be the same motivational force for today's youth as he was in his lifetime. Rashtraputra described as a great motivational movie with high voltage drama and entertainment values for the youth as well as the enlightened audience of twenty first century. Movie Rashtraputra is based on life and thoughts of Chandrashekhar Azad and also a tribute to all those forgotten heroes of freedom movement and to all those revolutionaries who didn't earned the fame they deserved viz. Mangal Pandey (Indian rebellion of 1857), Balwant Vasudev Phadke (Indian independence activist), Krantiveer Lahuji Raghoji Salve, Khudiram Bose (Bengali-Indian revolutionary), Rani Lakshmi Bai (Indian Rebellion of 1857), Chapekar Brothers (Assassination of W. C. Rand), Rash Behari Bose (Indian Independence Movement, Ghadar Revolution, Indian National Army, Jugantar), Aurobindo Ghosh (Alipore Bomb Case), Barindra Kumar Ghosh (Alipore Bomb Case, Jugantar), Jatindra Nath Das (Lahore Conspiracy Case), Bagha Jatin alias Jatin Das Mukherjee (German Plot during World War I), Ullaskar Dutta (Alipore Bomb Case), Hemu Kalani (Mahatma Gandhi's Quit India movement), Udham Singh (Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar), Subhash Chandra Bose (the Commander in Chief and founder of Azad Hind Fauj) and many more.

tt6973576,6557. Itanagar 0KM,"Produced by Alison Welly, ""Itanagar 0KM"" depicts the story of young a man and his struggle. Though Heartbroken and shattered; the film gives clue that he has a good life ahead. The major chunk has been given to unemployment problem. The protagonist does not sit idle waiting for some politician's help or any miracles to happen. In spite, he does all odd works including selling bamboo, giving tuition, engaging in poultry farm, even work as a cobbler but succeeds in none. Chima's (protagonist) struggles are symbol of every youth's struggle giving a message not to surrender during adversity. It is a story of a youth named Chime charmingly played by Tai Tugung who strives to make two ends meet and the journey of his topsy-turvy life. The audience gets a front-row seat as the film starts with heart touching dialogue between young friends Jumar and Chime through a letter, talking about the brighter and darker side of life that is offered to them separately. The film goes on from a small start of the difficult life of a child (chime) who works hard to find a job -to the ripple effects of unemployment in grown up Chime's life. Scoring some great emotional points, the central character Chime touches the heart of the audience with his natural performance. The characterisations have strong connecting points; opposite Tai Tugung is Nabam Ana who plays the role of Margam and is seen flaunting her kindness to support a struggler. Itanagar 0 Km, in a way, appears to be a reminisce of road trip films that have recently captured the imagination of Bollywood film-makers. The Bollywood industry that ranges from subject matters like corruption, an honest cop beating out the bad man, a common man's fight against the system have now ventured into this road trips genre. Itanagar 0 Km is close to that, having revealing moments like those of road trip movies where the protagonist's emotions are expressed in the short ride he takes, be it with his friend or wandering alone in the roadsides to riding back home after ""The Revelation"". Critics may judge minus for some stereotypes in the film. Apart from emotional outbursts, there are some jaw-cracking moments in the film that give the audience no time to adjust to the ¬giggle wavelength. The film is supported with melodious Hindi songs offering the conventional touch of Bollywood films to the audience. The makers of the film are confident that the people of the state will accept the film for its storyline more so for the Arunachalee brand of Hindi that is used in the film. This movie is based on a true story reflecting the contemporary society with special focus on the youth of our society, said the producer of the film Allison Welly on the premier night. Expressing much satisfaction with the release of Itanagar 0 Km, the proprietor of Cinepolis 3D Nending Lahzeey said that Cinepolis is lucky enough to have a role in promoting regional films, thereby encouraging local film-makers.

Afsar,"Synopsis Has been Written by Mr Rais Asghar, My Uncle, on 20 August 2018 (Rashid Ashraf) AFSAR-1950 Though not a blast from the past, the golden era of Indian cinema, film ""AFSAR"" of 1950, starring Dev Anand, Suriya with Kanhaiya Lal, Zohra Sehgal etc. Director Chetan Anand, Producer Dev Anand, though a really enjoyable classical comedy deep-set in a historical reality, seems to have been lost from the memory of even really old film lovers just as it has actually been lost from prints as neither DVD or Internet is available anywhere in Pakistan or even in India. The story is skillfully set in the last era of British rule when after several historical land reforms in the subcontinent, the government faced the gigantic problem of assessing the actual incomes of landlords to net them in for state revenues. For purpose of direct assessments revenue officers were deputed, while for a larger number of indirect assessments, persons were sent and dispersed to villages in disguise of varying professions and for longer periods to secretly make their own assessment of on the spot realities and of actual sources and incomes. Dev Anand a smart but long unemployed city youth unaware of the fact that persons have been secretly deputed in disguise to villages, goes along with an illiterate quirky assistant and with no equipment, bare straw furniture and with not even the barest of medical knowledge goes to a village and sets up a dispensary as a last attempt at livelihood. Soon the ludicrous village simpletons of various sizes and shapes with rustic attires, accents and ways, a real entertainment to watch in the film, finding Dev Anand far removed from their lot, start spying on his activities, peeping in the dispensary through its falling windows and holes, and begin to spin up tales of him being of the disguised agents rumored to have been sent to asses incomes and their sources, and cook up their stories so convincingly that the owner of the entire village, the landlord, already under fear of losing some of his income and even property to the state, believes his men and their tales. He invites Dev Anand to his impressive haveli, gives him a reception and respect and starts discussions on some medical issues. However the unconvincing, naïve and evasive replies of Dev Anand on medicine further leads the landlord to believe that he is really the agent sent by the state to rope him and his vast income. He offers Dev Anand to stay at his haveli and Dev by now having realized what his is being mistaken for, starts skillfully playing the role of his mistaken identity or rather misperceived identity. The landlord introduces Dev Anand made purposely as a permanent guest to his daughter who is learning dancing and music, and she entertains Dev Anand with some classical songs and dances which are a part of the film. Without much time and effort while staying at the haveli Dev Anand seduces her by his charms into a relationship without thinking of the consequences. The landlord had been advised by his men that whatever reports Dev Anand sends to his superiors in the city will necessarily go through the village post office where by design it can be checked and brought back to the landlord to have him see its contents. Call it misfortune or climax to come Dev Anand sends a letter to a friend in his city, narrating to him how he is enjoying in the village due to a mistaken identity. He also comments on each, the landlord his daughter and village folk, and their idiosyncrasies in the most humorous and somewhere disparaging words. This letter by scheme lands back in the hands of the landlord and read in a village gathering. Dev Anand is also informed by some one of the letter falling into the villagers hands, and he plans to escape. However he confides to the landlords daughter that he is not the one they all are thinking to be, but is just an unemployed miserable young man, who had come to set up a dispensary in the village. The heroine says she accepts he as he is and will always be his companion, and both plan to run away from the village and make for the small railway station. In the meantime the villagers, who had read the letter exposing Dev Anand, and his sarcastic comments about all in the village, and knowing that he has fled with the landlord's daughter, run towards the railway station. While they are after him, chasing the pair ferociously, Dev and his eloping lady miss the train by a few minutes. What happens can be well imagined, but the end is not within the memory of this writer.

tt7814830,7096. The Men in the Tree,"In October 1992, Lalit Vachani and the Wide Eye Film team were filming The Boy in the Branch. At the time, Kali, the central character of the film, was nine years old. He had joined the RSS branch because it was a fun place where children could play games after school every day.Sandeep, twenty-one years old, spoke about his devotion to the Hindu nationalist cause, and how he would spend his life serving the RSS. Sripad, an RSS martial arts expert (nineteen at the time) was passionate about building his own body and building the Hindu nation. And Lalit, age eighteen, was a gentle, atypical volunteer who disliked the physical program of the RSS, even though he was assigned to train the younger boys in Karate. We had entered RSS territory expecting to confirm our received images of fascism. Instead, what we found was far more ingenious and unsettling in its simplicity: the lure of a playground where young boys played games and the hopes and dreams, fears and anxieties of ordinary young people as the banal face of fundamentalism. On December 6th, 1992, 45 days after the shoot when the film was near completion, members of the RSS and its affiliates destroyed the Babri mosque at Ayodhya. Where were Lalit, Kali, Sripad, and Sandeep when the mosque was razed to the ground? What did they think about the deaths of at least 1500 people (mostly Muslim) in the riots that followed the demolition? What had happened to them since that time, as the RSS and Hindu nationalism moved from the margins to the center of Indian politics, from an oppositional movement to the ideology of the government presently in power? --- Eight years later, we returned to Nagpur in search of Kali, Sandeep, Sripad and Lalit. Combining the conventions of the political documentary and the personal 'revisit', The Men in the Tree is a documentary in four parts: Part I, Memories (22 min.) is a personal reflection on the making of the earlier film, The Boy in the Branch. (please link to this film here) Part II, Buildings (24 min.) builds on the characters of The Boy in the Branch, in that we meet Sandeep, Sripad and Kali in the present, after a gap of eight years. However, it is primarily about the making and the breaking of various buildings, the most prominent one being the Babri mosque, destroyed in December 1992. Part III, Stories (32 min.) is the talking heads/information section of the film. It is about the kind of stories that circulate within the RSS branch and broader RSS culture and the attempts by RSS ideologues to rewrite and Hinduize a secular Indian history. Former RSS volunteers, D.R. Goyal and Purshottam Agarwal provide an internal critique and a framework to understand the ambivalence of the RSS to national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and contextualize the RSS hostility towards Muslim and Christian minorities in India. Part IV, Branches (20 min.) is about the state of RSS branches in contemporary India in the form of a return to the branches that the team filmed in 1992. The film ends with an epilogue concerning the events of March 2002. At the time, The Men in the Tree was almost complete. The RSS affiliate, the VHP launched a new agitation to build the Ram temple at Ayodhya. This resulted in the horrifying genocide in Gujarat, where estimates suggest that over two thousand Muslims were killed by members of the Hindu right.",2002,Rate,142

He rescues her and accompanies her to her parents' home and asks them for her hand in marriage, to which they agree. The marriage takes place with great pomp and ceremony. After the marriage their life is virtually perfect. Then one day, Jalandhar gets a visit from a Sage who tells him that there is war going between the Devas (Gods) and Danavs (Demons), and that Bhagwan Vishnu has been siding with the Devas. Curious to find out more, Jalandhar journeys to his father, Sagar (Ocean), who tells that he had attempted to make peace between the Devas and the Danavs by offering them sweet nectar of life, but Bhagwan Vishnu had taken the shape of a beautiful woman, Mohini, and made sure that only the Devas got the nectar. Jalandhar is angered at this, and declares war against Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas. Vrunda begs him not to go, as Vishnu is all powerful. When he insists on going, she prays to the Gods and puts a flowered garland (full of blessings) around his neck to ensure his safety. Jalandhar defeats Indra Dev and comes home victorious, along with Indraloks apsaras (beautiful women) and Indrani herself. The enraged Devas appeal to Bhagwan Vishnu, who agrees to do battle with Jalandhar, but again Jalandhar triumphs, and thus becomes Bhagwan Jalandhar. The worried Devas approach Bhagwan Shiv, who refuses to get involved in any war with anyone. In the meantime, Jalandhar gets angry with Vrunda for worshiping Vishnu and cuts her tongue off so as to prevent her from praying. She goes to pray to Vishnu, and he reinstates her tongue. This angers Jalandhar all the more, and in penance Vrunda blinds herself, and is placed in a dungeon surrounded by a wall of fire. Jalandhar now wants the most beautiful woman in the world, and he is told that there is no one more beautiful than Bhagwan Shiva's wife, Parvati. He accordingly sends word for Parvati to come to him. This angers Shiv and he goes to battle Jalandhar. Once again Jalandhar triumphs, and is all set to have Parvati for his own. Parvati and the other Devas now approach Bhagwan Shri Brahma for a solution. In the meantime, Vrunda regains her eyesight, and to her delight finds that Jalandhar has changed, and they spend a lot of time together. Days later, the severed head of Jalandhar comes into their palace, and accuses Vrunda of infidelity. Vrunda is astounded as she has always been true to her husband, but then there was the severed head floating in the air, and there was her husband standing next to her. She soon finds out that the person standing next to her is Bhagwan Vishnu who had assumed the form of Jalandhar, the real Jalandhar had been defeated by Bhagwan Shiv in battle, and his head severed from his body. Now Bhagwan Vishnu and the Devas have to content with Vrunda's wrath - and she wills Vishnu to become of stone for pulling wool over her eyes, and then she turns her wrath on the rest of the Devas. Will anyone or anything be able to stop Vrunda?",1971,7.2,145

They meet in Japan and the inevitable happens when hero meets heroine. Lord Bertrand Russell in London, gives Gautam his blessings and best wishes for his travel to Japan. Russell , a pacifist and anti-war thinker (who appears in a cameo role) sets the tone of this 1967 film. On arrival in Japan Dr Gautamdas takes up a role in a hospital where Meloda's father Dr Akhira (Chetan Anand) is director. The storyline takes us through the stark and sometimes gory suffering that radiation victims endured; as a stark reminder of the long term damage caused by atomic weapons. A majority of the shoot sequences are in Japan, with director Mohan Kumar taking artistic liberties in switching from the Ginza strip, with pan shots of the Mitsubishi tower, the Hokkaido and with glimpses of Mt. Fuji. A scenic gondola ride, ski fields are all part of the package. Lata Mangeshkar's rendering of the fusion song ""aisuru"" is set to a musical score that is drawn from both cultures Shankar. Mohammed Rafi sings a few forgettable, but apt to the storyline songs. A group of fishermen are exposed to radiation from French nuclear tests in the Pacific, Dr Gautamdas mounts a daring rescue to help save the fishermen. Battling angry elements Dr Gautamdas helps the fishermen survive, saving every last one of them - but at what cost? When viewed in the context of India-Japan relationship, beginning with the arrival of Buddism in Japan, formation of the Indo-Japan Society in 1905, Japan's support for Subash Chandra Bose's INA this film takes on a meaning beyond a love story.

But people are not even touching me, it feels like I have a disease. Those who came to celebrate also left. People wanted to kill me, thinking, 'I am a girl and what can I give except defamation?'The only person who was fully supporting me was my mother. I was dead in the eyes of the world, but I was in an orphanage. I had a full family, but still I was in an orphanage.There was not a single day when my mother didn't come to meet me and feed me milk. She used to take full care of me and lie to my mother and family that I was going to meet my friend. Every day my mother made new excuses.One day I had a high fever and that day my mother stayed with me all day and went back home after putting me to sleep. Dad asked how it was so late and she said that my friend was unwell and I was helping her. Dad also beat up mom that day in anger. My mother was in pain, but still hiding me, she thought I was a child, what would I understand, but it was not so, I understood everything.I also thought I'd be knowledgeable. I went to madam and on requesting a lot, she told me everything. Hearing all this, I got very angry, I thought that I have to do something different.When something grew up, I joined the boxing club. When I turned 18, I got the title of state champion. Two months later, I had a national match with a Pakistani girl. When the media came to interview me, I got a call from my mother and she said, 'Daughter, please don't harm your family.' I was laughing that my mother was still saving her family. I gave an interview and the whole public heard that interview on TV. In the evening, mom told that while watching TV, papa was saying that wow what a girl, how much name she is bringing to her parents and family.They had left me saying That I am Kulakshmi. Today they wanted to meet me and take photos with me but even today they were unaware of who I am.Exactly two months later, there was a National Championship match and they all came to see me. A lot of people had come to watch the match and everyone was saying - ""You can do it"" but my eyes were looking for my family in that crowd. When I saw my family in the distant crowd, I was angry and I vented all the anger on my opponent and won the national title.Then what, everyone became interested in me, people started asking me about my family. Very compelled, I told him that I was the girl who was killed 20 years ago who was first given the name ""sofia"". My whole family's eyes were moist.Just then someone came running from the distant crowd and called me a daughter, it was as if it was like a dream for me, the childhood love I had lost, I suddenly got it and she hugged me and said to everyone - ""This is my daughter"" who gave me the right to be a father.

This motto of Narsi Mehta was remembered in morning prayers of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers. After 500 years, the spirit of Narsi Mehta was re-born in Mahatma Gandhi. . Narsi was a poor mute boy, born in Brahmin family of Junagadh (Saurashtra) in 15th Century. From very childhood he had great leaning towards Sadhus and was fond of attending Kirtans. Once he came in contact of a saint, and by the blessing of the saint Narsi obtained the power of speech- and thus from the childhood, he become great devotee of God. . Narsis grand mother and elder brother were not in favour of his assoiciation with Sadhus and his learning towards Bhakti, therefore they arranged his marriage with Manik Mehti, and after some years Narsi became the father of son and a daughter. But during all these years Narsis inclination towards Bhakti was unchanged. His Bhabi (brothers wife) became envious because of his fruitless activities, and started taunting and harrassing him, his wife, son and daughter. Sarangdhar( the brother of Narsis Bhabi) employed malacious tractis and ultimately succeeded in separating Narsi and his family from his brother. . Narsi Mehta who was a great devotee, and for whose honour God performed miracles on the occasions of his grand mothers death ceremony ( Sharadh- Tehri) and Mamera (Bhat) of his grand daughtes marriage; was a believer in equality of rights for every human being. He could not see merciless and inhuman treatment of priests and Brahmins towards Untouchables. He opposed vehemantly the cast order and rude behaviour of high placed people of the society. Sarandhar all the while was instigating the citizens and was gathering hooligans against him. Thus Narsi became the torch-bearer of social revolution. . Mandlik-the king of Junagadh-called Narsi in his court and asked him to sing Kedar Raag. Narsi could not do so, as he had mortgaged the same with some one. Mandlik ordered his imprisonment and a miracle took place. Sarangdhar represented to the King that Narsi has obtained black powers and it is he who has done this......However, God Almighty came to the rescue of his great devotee, and Narsi was able to establish himself as the True Devoteee of God.",1957,7.7,163

A herculean fist of the tramp sent him reeling on the ground, depriving him of his eyesight. . the circumstances sometimes behave with us very mathematically. Bindiya took him to the nearest doctor, who was a very kindhearted social worker. He admitted him in his small hospital-which was incidentally his home-and began to treat him for his eye trouble. Ashok met Geeta the doctors daughter,refined and cultured. Her chisel carved face and the graceful body impressed him as an angel of sublimity and beauty. In the absence of her father, she nursed his physique and soul. She sang a song which inspired Ashok to work on his novel. . The circumstances play the game of chess in mans life. Ashok thought of his weakness of economic condition and felt it too bad to visit Geeta. He resolved to meet her after getting sufficiently rich to stand with her family on the same level. He began to work on his novel with vigorous spirit and enthusiasm. . He often met Bindiya while he was writing his novel on the river bank. He liked to talk to her and listened to her innocent, lovely, chirping voice. She imagined the world too beautiful. . He liked her for her fancies and dreams. She loved him sincerely, truly. She thought he also loved her. Ashok loved Geeta, the paragon of beauty, culture and learning. Sometimes circustances play the game of hide and seek with human beings. Once Bindiya and Geeta met at the river bank. They went sentimental over theirboy. Their emotions clashed. There was a mighty storm in their hearts. Ultimately,Sublimity gave way to Innocence. . But the fate calculated their lives to be different. Ashok loved Geeta. He liked Bindiya but never loved her. But Geeta had given him up and had never shown a sign of remembering him. Once she very politely turned him out of her house. Ashok was flabbergasted, stunned. He couldnt read his future. It was all darkness. . The circustances were playing with him. They were responsible for many tears and blood. They alone can determine the shape of the lives of Bindiya, Geeta and Ashok. Let us watch them.",1948,7.1,165
